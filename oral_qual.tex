\section*{Abstract}
The aim of this document is to provide the committee a quick recap of the s-process, and how I aim to 
contribute to further its understanding. The first section is a brief recap, but granted not a complete 
one, on the s-process. The following four will outline tools being developed, and aspects that are being 
studied. In the last section I will conclude how the project will come together.
